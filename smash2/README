Project : Smash part 2
CS253-Jim Conrad
*************


Overview:

We are going to implement a our bash shell that we have used in part 1 called smash to make part 2 that also has functionality called history


Compiling and running the program:


- Clean up the directory

 $ make clean

- Make your project from Makefile

$ make 

-Run the program

$ ./smash

* This  file will be created for you after making the project


Discussion:

In this project we are going to expand smash 1 and it's functionality by adding another feature called history

So for that reason we need ... history.h(The prototypes of our history functions) and history.c(The functions that we are going to add to have process on history)

Methods inside of history.c:

history init_history() -> Intialize and return the history
void add_history -> Stores history
void clear_history -> Clears history
void print_history -> Prints the history

Functionality and Tests:

$ history -> Supposed to show the enteries that so far we had in our program
$ cd -> should change directory if we have valid directory 
example : cd /tmp is valid 
cd /hello is not valid 
$ (other tokens) -> should be parsed and printed on the seprate lines
$ exit -> should exit the program and clears the history 

Files Included are:

* smash.c

* history.c

* history.h

* README
